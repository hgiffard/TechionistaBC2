# Techionista Business Case 2 Vendee Global

The second business case we did this year was to stream data from a fictional Vendee Global race. The data was produced by a program, not by actual boats. We used Power BI to plot where the boats were and a program to calculate the place of each boat in the race. Since our data came from the start of the race, it was legitimate to calculate place in the race based on distance from the starting point, which we did in a python workbook run with a Synapse data pipeline.

The code and Power BI report included here are for the batch data, calculated through the workbook. The live streaming data went directly to Power BI - this was done by other members of my team!
